        <h1>Sable and Self-Determination</h1>
        <h3>28 March 2022</h3>
        <p>It's hard to articulate my thoughts on this game. As someone navigating a breakup, nearing college graduation, looking for a start to a career, and facing moving out, I empathize with Sable more than any character of any game or movie I've experienced. The notion of exploring, searching for one's self, and not only that but questioning the meaning behind said search and the methods of going about it--all of these I am intimately familiar with.</p>

        <p>In a previous draft, I had written more about details of the game and why I love the music, sound effects, color palette, character interactions, lore, and many more things, but Sable herself and her journey are the biggest elements of this game I adore. I simply have not come across a form of media that better captures this tumultuous window of time in one's life of self exploration and decision. The pinnacle of Sable's arc--deciding her mask and, in that, who she is and who she will be--is incredibly powerful and thought provoking. During the arc, when talking with Llhor about why someone goes about this journey and how to come to the final decision of what to do with one's self, I couldn't help but reflect upon my own life. Who am I? Who will I be? What will be my career, my hobbies? What defines me and how do I choose it? All of these questions circle through my head daily. It's simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. What if I choose wrong? What if I could have done something better? Worse still, what if I become paralyzed in indecision and miss my opportunity? However, what if I choose rightâ€“accomplish my goals? My dreams? What if I stand at the end of the day knowing the triumph of high achievement?</p>
        <p>At one point late into the game, when I had felt the time for going back to the Ibex camp and choosing a mask for Sable was near, I passed by the arched entrance to the Ewer while traveling south through the Sansee at night. As the piano of the soundtrack played calmly, I felt a strong sense of nostalgia--one I only feel when reminiscing on the friends and memories of high school and early college, laughing at how young and immature and dumb I was. Except, this time, it was thinking amusingly back to when Sable first left the canyon--how expansive the world was outside of it. It was awe-inspiring. Now, after traversing the entirety of Midden, I look and see how truly small the canyon is. How is this game making me feel like this? Am I so invested in the journey of Sable that I feel for her as I feel for my own path in life?</p>

        <p>Truly I don't know. As I opened with, the experience of this game is hard to articulate or quantify. However, it stands alone as being the one piece of media to hit me this hard and prompt so much introspection. Nothing else better represents the path of self determination and self reflection we all go through in life.</p>
        <p>Thank you, ShedWorks and Japanese Breakfast, this game is wonderful.</p>
