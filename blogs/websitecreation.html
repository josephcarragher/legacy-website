        <h1>Website Creation</h1>
        <h3>18 December 2021</h3>
        <p>Finally getting around to this is exciting. I can finally satiate some of my data hoarding urges while simultaneously creating a comfy small internet nook like it's 2005. I expect large changes to come to the site as I learn more about HTML, Markdown, CSS, and the like. Maybe this blog will look better then. lol.</p>
        <p>Soon I'll be documenting my dive into FPGA development (I'm positively giddy at the prospect of making a crappy SHA3 mining bitstream). I've spent what I deem to be an appropriate amount of time learning about HDL and encryption algorithms before now diving headfirst into making one. The best way to learn, is to do!</p>
