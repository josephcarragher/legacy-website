        <h1>Consumerism in Hobbies</h1>
        <h3>22 July 2022</h3>
        <p>There is a line that can exist between having something as a necessary tool and having something as a hobby. It is very easy to lose sight of where this line lies. This can lead to the feeling of needing something when the item in question would have no necessary place in your toolset. It would only serve to amuse you as a hobbyist. Being aware of this distinction is key to fending off unnecessary consumerism in both. By doing this, you can maintain a more healthy, anxiety-free mindset. When faced with the question of adding another item to your toolset, ask yourself: “What is the practical change this will make for my use case?”. When answering this, be mindful of your own limitations rather than just the hardware's limitations--in many cases, you are the bottleneck, not the machine. Skill issue and thus driver mod is needed.</p>
